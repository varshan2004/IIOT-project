Aim: To develop a smart irrigation system using cisco packet tracer
Scope of the solution: using water level sensors we can measure water level and with integration of home gateway ,the system is set to automatic when the water level 
                          gets low sprinklers are triggered to turn on
Required components: water level sensors,lawn sprinklers,home gateway,tablet
result:smart irrigation system is setup successfully using IOT devices(home gateway,tablet,etc,.)
